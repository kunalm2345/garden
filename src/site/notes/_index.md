I'm 16. Studying 11th grade, growing [HelloMeets](https://hellomeets.com/)' organic traffic with [SEO](/seo) and running [Back of my Head](https://subscribepage.com/bomh), my weekend recommendations newsletter.

My side projects for now:

- **[Twift](/twift)**: Those "reply with an emoji" giveaways are one of the best ways to launch something on Twitter. And Twift just makes running them a lot easier. 
- **[Socialscribe](/socialscribe)**: Socialscribe is a no-code way to add "subscribe w/ Twitter" button to your newsletter's landing page. So someone can click on a button and subscribe in 1-click, without typing their whole email.

I also [read books](/books) and [articles](https://getpocket.com/@knl), admire good [typography](/type), [code](https://github.com/kunalm2345) (mainly in Python, but also learning JavaScript), explore new apps and tools, sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/knlmsh), geek over my Roam setup, spend a lot of time making up words and checking if their domains are available, and more.
